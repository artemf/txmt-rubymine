TextMate Protocol Handler (txmt://) for RubyMine (Mac OS X)
=============

If you want to open local files in RubyMine by clicking on txmt:// urls in [better_errors](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors) or [rails-footnotes](https://github.com/josevalim/rails-footnotes), this app is for you.

**No gems, no plugins, no installs, no configuration, no frills.**

### Installation

Just download and extract app from `RubyMineTextMateHandler.zip` somewhere (no need to put in Application folder) and that's it. Now go and click some links!

### Source code

See this app's source code in `RubyMineTextMateHandler.applescript`. This is just an AppleScript app with some tweaks to open txmt:// url's

### Contributing

Send changes to `RubyMineTextMateHandler.applescript`, not the app itself
